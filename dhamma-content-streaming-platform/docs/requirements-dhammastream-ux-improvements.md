- **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, prototype testing, expert consultation

**Medium Risk:**
- **User Adoption**: Changes to familiar interface patterns
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, user education, feedback integration

**Low Risk:**
- **Performance Impact**: New features affecting site speed
- **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, optimization strategies, CDN usage

### 8.3 Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Supabase platform stability and feature availability
