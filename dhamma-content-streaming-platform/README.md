# Dhamma Content Streaming Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

This project is a web-based platform for streaming Dhamma talks and lectures. It features a Next.js frontend and uses Supabase for its database and backend services.

## Features

- **Browse Content:** Users can browse content by type (video, audio, ebook).
- **Speakers:** View a list of speakers and their content.
- **Search:** Search for content and speakers.
- **Pagination:** Paginated content for easy browsing.
- **Video/Audio Player:** A responsive media player for video and audio content.
- **Resume Playback:** The player remembers the user's position in a video or audio file.
- **Dark Mode:** The application supports a dark mode theme.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
